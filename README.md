# DomeNotes
This is a simple to-do list application created with Firebase using CRUD operations.
Since I'm still not proficient in creating web APIs or using Express. I opted to use Firebase for my work. 
I didn't waste time there because I didn't know ExpressJS well enough.

# What I have done exactly?
Thus, I used the most recent version of React Native to construct an application that even supports Expo. Therefore, I would advise that you use Expo Go to execute this program. I did, however, use the straightforward stack navigation and user interface instead of the Expo router. I even use Yup for validation and Formik for form development. In addition, I have separate paths for services like firestore and auth. 

There was a create user and signup procedure inside Auth, but I am unable to create one because of an auth constraint on my Firebase Account after generating one. Please verify the code, but first I'd want to share the login credentials.
