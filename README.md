# DomeNotes
This is a simple to-do list application created with Firebase using CRUD operations.
Since I'm still not proficient in creating web APIs or using Express. I opted to use Firebase for my work. 
I didn't waste time there because I didn't know ExpressJS well enough.

# What I have done exactly?
Thus, I used the most recent version of React Native to construct an application that even supports Expo. 
Therefore, I would advise that you use Expo Go to execute this program. 
I did, however, use the straightforward stack navigation and user interface instead of the Expo router.
